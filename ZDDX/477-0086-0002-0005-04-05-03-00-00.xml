Never before has it done it inside. Never before has it done it outside. And never before has it brought all that intelligence to your Z-Wave network. The Aeotec by Aeon Labs MultiSensor looks like a motion sensor and acts like one too. But its also so much more. Placing this one piece of Z-Wave technology either in the corner of a room or outside is the same as placing 4 pieces of Z-Wave technology. But those 4 pieces of technology, those 4 pieces of intelligence that you can bring to your Z-Wave network, all live within a single, stunning sensor.</lang></description><productName>Multisensor</productName><brandName>Aeotec</brandName><productCode>DSB05-ZWAU</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="0084" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC08-13030010"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
