menu. You can switch on and off a node in case it is a switch binary device and set a multilevel value if it is a dimmer device. myDisplay only supports switch binary and switch multilevel devices so you need to configure generic type of a
product. See command class configuration parameter offset 3352 how to do this. The default is
GENERIC_TYPE_SWITCH_BINARY.</lang>
