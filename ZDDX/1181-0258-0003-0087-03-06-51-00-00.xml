All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.In the front casing, there is button that is used to carry out include, exclude or reset factory default settings on PCB Board.When power is first supplied, the LED will flash on and off with yellow alternately every 1 second intervals within 5 seconds if the detector has not been added a Z-Wave network, otherwise the LED will flash on and off 5 times with cyan alternately every 300 millisecond. Please get familiar with the terms below before starting the operations.This Plug has function that remembers the relay states, the plug will turn on after power up next time if the plug is turn on before the power cut-off.</lang></description><productName>Wall Plug </productName><brandName>Coolcam</brandName><productCode>NAS-WR01Z</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="005e" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><assocGroups><assocGroup number="1" maxNodes="3"><description><lang xml:lang="en">AssociationsThrough an association this Plug may control another Z-Wave network device, e.g. a alarm device, wall plug, lighting etc.The Wall Plug provides three association groups, and every group can be support to associated 5devices max.GROUP 1 is lifeline service that assigned to plug statusON/OFF. It enables the Plug to send reports and readings to Z-Wave Controller or Z-Wave Gateway. This Group Support:NOTIFICATION_REPORT_V4 COMMAND_CLASS_METER_V4 COMMAND_CLASS_SWITCH_BINARY DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATIONGROUP 2 allows for sending control commands to associated devices such as Siren, relay module, lighting, etc. If current load is over the max current defined in parameter #3, the Plug will send a BASIC_SET (0xFF) to associated devices. When current load is normal, plug will send a BASIC_SET (0x00) to associated devices. This Group Support:BASIC_SETGROUP 3 allows for Send Notification to associated devices in this group.
