This Wall Mounted Switch is designed to work with other Z-Wave enabled devices. Z-Wave nodes of other types can be added to the system and will also act as repeaters if they support this function of repeating the signal received to other modules in the system.As part of a Z-Wave network, the TZ56S will also act as a wireless repeater to insure that commands intended for another device in the network are received. This is useful when the device would otherwise be out of the radio range of the wireless controller.SPEC:Voltage: 230 VAC, 50 HzSignal (Frequency): 868.42 MHzMaximum LoadResistive: 6 amps (1380 watts) maximum, 230 VACRange: Up to 30 meters line of sight between the Wireless Controller and /or the closest Z-Wave Receiver Module.</lang></description><productName>TKB Switch TZ56S</productName><brandName>TKB Home</brandName><productCode>TZ56S</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="0086" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC08-15070008"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
