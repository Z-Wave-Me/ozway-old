The detector can be used as a security device or home automation device.When the detector is cooperated with security appliances, the detector is acting as a security device by detecting changes in infra-red radiation levels. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted to cause full alarm condition in order to frighten intruders away. Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave Controller , the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in infra-red radiation levels and percentage of lux levels.Once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected lightings for better illumination.Two mounting methods are provided for varying detection range.The detector can be mounted on a wall for farther detecting distance but narrower coverage; while for ceiling mounting, shorter detecting distance can be made but desired coverage can be expected at users disposal.</lang></description><productName>PIR Sensor</productName><brandName>Everspring</brandName><productCode>SP814</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="0084" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><resourceLinks><manualUrl url="http://www.everspring.com/SP814.aspx"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
