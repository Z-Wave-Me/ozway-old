All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network.In the Back casing, there is a button that is used to carry out include, exclude, wakeup device or reset factory default settings.When power is first supplied, the LED will flash on and off alternately at one second intervals within 5 seconds if the detector has not been added a Z-Wave network. Please get familiar with the terms below before starting the operations.</lang></description><productName>PIR sensor </productName><brandName>Coolcam</brandName><productCode>NAS-PD01Z</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="005e" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><assocGroups><assocGroup number="1" maxNodes="4"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Associations (Association Command Class Version 2)This Sensor supports 4 association groups. This has the effect that when the sensor is triggered, all devices associated with the sensor will receive the relevant reports. Through an association the sensor may control another Z-Wave network device, e.g. a alarm device, wall plug, lamp etc.Every group can be support to associated 4 devices max.GROUP 1 is lifeline service that assigned to Sensor (Motion detector) statusOpen/Close. It enables the sensor to send reports and readings to Z-Wave Controller or Z-Wave Gateway whenever the sensor is triggered. This Group Support:NOTIFICATION_REPORT COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_BINARY_V2 COMMAND_CLASS_SENSOR_MULTILEVEL_V7 BATTERY_REPORT DEVICE_RESET_LOCALLY_NOTIFICATIONGROUP 2 allows for sending control commands to associated devices such as relay module, lighting, etc. This association group is configured through the advanced parameters no. 2, 3, 5 and 8. This Group Support:BASIC_SETGROUP 3 allows for Send Notification to associated devices in this group. This Group Support: NOTIFICATION_REPORT_V4GROUP 4 allows for Send Notification to associated devices in this group. This Group Support: SENSOR_BINARY_REPORT_V2</lang></description></assocGroup></assocGroups><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC10-16020007"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
