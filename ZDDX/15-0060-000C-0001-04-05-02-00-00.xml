Z-Wave enabled devices displaying the Z-Wave logo can also be used with it regardless of the manufacturer, and ours can also be used in other manufacturers Z-Wave enabled networks.Inclusion of this Indoor Siren on other manufacturers Wireless Controller menu allows a full alarm condition to be generated once a connected Z-Wave enabled device has been triggered.Z-Wave enabled devices (refer to nodes) in the system also act as repeaters, so as to re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its intended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots.The Indoor Siren integrates both functions of siren and strobe into one unit.Two sound levels, 100dB and 90dB, are available for selection.When it receives a RF command, it will either activate its sounder and flash lights or stop these visual and audible alarm indications. </lang></description><productName>Indoor Siren</productName><brandName>Everspring</brandName><productCode>SE812-ANZ</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="0086" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><resourceLinks><manualUrl url="http://www.everspring.com/SE812.aspx"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
