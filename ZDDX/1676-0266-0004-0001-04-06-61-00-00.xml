The water alarm can be connected to any Z-Wave main controller. Different countries or areas, the radio frequency of the Z-Wave is different. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. In the Z-Wave network communications, the water alarm can communicate with other devices associated. When the water leak is detected, the sensor will send messages to the main controller, and then the alarm sound. Through the Z-Wave network, the devices associated can response after water leak is detected, For instance, the water valve can be turned off and the alarm device can be triggered. Through the Z-Wave network controller, you can get the status of the sensor, such as battery level, also you will be notified when the water is leaking.The water alarm is small and battery powered, it works on the hard or soft surfaces, such as carpet, floor etc. when water leak cause the two sensing probes to be short circuit, the water alarm will sound.</lang></description><productName>Wireless Water Leak Alarm</productName><brandName>Siterwell Technology</brandName><productCode>GS156B</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses/><assocGroups><assocGroup number="1" maxNodes="1"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Z-Wave Plus Lifeline</lang></description></assocGroup><assocGroup number="2" maxNodes="5"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Linkage group 2 is assigned to the devices status - sending BASIC SET control frame to the associated devices having detected the water leak.Note that only when the sensor detects the leak, the sensor will send BASIC SET 0xFF, there are no report (BASIC SET 0x00) will be sent after the leak is cleared.</lang></description></assocGroup><assocGroup number="3" maxNodes="5"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Linkage group 3 reports the detection's status to the associated device. </lang></description></assocGroup></assocGroups><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC10-17035476"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
