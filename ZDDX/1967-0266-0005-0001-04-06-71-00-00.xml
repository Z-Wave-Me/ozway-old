It is operated by 3v AA Alkaline battery. With the photoelectric technology, it is more sensitive in detecting slow smoldering fires which generate light smoke. little heat and may smolder for hours before bursting into flames. This smoke alarm does not contain any radioactive material.The smoke alarm is an intelligent security equipment that can be controlled by the Z-Wave network which has particular frequency. Different countries or areas, the radio frequency of the Z-Wave is different. This product can be included and operated in any Z-Wave network with other Z-Wave certified devices from other manufacturers and/or other applications. All non-battery operated nodes within the network will act as repeaters regardless of vendor to increase reliability of the network. In the Z-Wave network communications, the smoke alarm can communicate with other devices associated. When the smoke is detected, the sensor will send messages to the main controller, and then the alarm sound. Through the Z-Wave network, the devices associated can response after smoke is detected, For instance , Start fire extinguishing equipment and trigger an alarm, Through the Z-Wave network controller, You will be notified in case of fire.</lang></description><productName>Smoke Alarm Sensor</productName><brandName>siterwell</brandName><productCode>GS559B</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses/><assocGroups><assocGroup number="1" maxNodes="4"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Z-Wave Plus Lifeline</lang></description></assocGroup><assocGroup number="2" maxNodes="4"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Linkage group 2 is assigned to the devices status - sending BASIC SET control frameto the associated devices having detected the smoke alarm.</lang></description></assocGroup><assocGroup number="3" maxNodes="4"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Linkage group 3 reports the detection's status to the associated device. smoke alarm</lang></description></assocGroup><assocGroup number="4" maxNodes="4"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Linkage group 4 is assigned to the devices status - sending BASIC SET control frameto the associated devices having detected the heat alarm.</lang></description></assocGroup><assocGroup number="5" maxNodes="4"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Linkage group 5 reports the detection's status to the associated device.</lang></description></assocGroup></assocGroups><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC10-17095785"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
