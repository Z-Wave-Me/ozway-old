Device can be battery (ca. 2 years battery life) or VDC powered (12 or 24 VDC). Flood alarm is sent to the Z-Wave network devices or additionally to any alarm system controller, through opening a NC contact.The device has built in temperature sensor, monitoring temperature of e.g. floor. Fibaro Flood Sensor is designed to be placed on the floor or on a wall with a flood sensor probe extended by connected wire. The device has built in LED indicator and acoustic alarm. In addition, the sensor is equipped with a tilt sensor reporting tilt or movement to the main controller e.g. when someone has taken the Sensor from its original location. LED diode signals flood, operating mode or the Z-Wave network communication range. Fibaro Flood Sensor is sink-proof, which means it drifts on the water surface and keeps on sending alarm signal in case of substantial inundation of water</lang></description><productName>FIBARO Flood Sensor</productName><brandName>FIBARO</brandName><productCode>FGFS-101</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="0084" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC08-14020003"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
