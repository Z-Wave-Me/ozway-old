Using your app and controller/gateway, you can turn your lights on, off and dim them down to 5% brightness from anywhere in the world, using your smartphone. At 2700K and 800 lumens, it is a true 60W equivalent. Another one this is where the innovative technology takes over. You get your basic On, Off and Dim, but now you have the ability to tune the white color from a warm 2700K to a cool 6500K. The ability to tune the white is what we call Tunable White, or TW. Having this ability, and the ability from your app, you can now set the perfect scene and mood in your home. In the evening, while watching TV, you may want to tune down the white color to a warm, cozy 2700K. Or maybe your kids have homework, and its late, so to help keep their concentration, you turn the white color up to 6500K, which is similar to daylight.With all of our lighting, and the app that supports it, you can group lights together, set different lighting scenes for different groups and set schdules to autotmatically turns lights, and groups, on and off. Our connected lighting has the additional option for what we call Saved State. Saved State allows you to save an actual light setting in the bulb itself. This means that when you lose power, the lights will not come back on to the standard, blaring 2700K at full bright. The Saved State will allow the lights to come back on to the nice setting youve previously saved.LEEDARSON stays on the cutting edge of technology and innovation. Thats because they have a responsibility to their customers. Thats because at LEEDARSON, We build your success in IoT.</lang></description><productName> A19 LED BULB TUNABLE WHITE</productName><brandName>LEEDARSON</brandName><productCode>6VB-A806ST-Q1Z</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses/><assocGroups><assocGroup number="1" maxNodes="1"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Z-Wave Plus Lifeline</lang></description></assocGroup></assocGroups><configParams><configParam number="255" size="4" default="0" type="rangemapped"><name><lang xml:lang="en">Reset</lang></name><description><lang xml:lang="en">Reset to factory configuration and removed the Z-Wave network.Reset Configuration parameter to default value.</lang></description><value from="-2004318072" to="-2004318072"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Reset to factory configuration and removed the Z-Wave network.</lang></description></value><value from="-2013265920" to="-2013265920"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Reset Configuration parameter to default value.</lang></description></value></configParam></configParams><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC10-17035468"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
