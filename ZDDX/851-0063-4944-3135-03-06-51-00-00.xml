The Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch enables wireless control of on/off and dim functions of hard-wired dimmable LED/CFL and incandescent lighting. The dimmer switch replaces your current light switch, uses your existing wiring, and provides Z-Wave wireless and in-wall control of overhead lighting. Use the dimmer feature to customize the lighting output and create the perfect ambiance for any room. Providing ultimate flexibility, the Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Control Dimmer Switch allows you to operate the switch by itself or easily integrate the switch with two-way, three-way or four-way wiring configurations by adding the Jasco Auxiliary switch for Z-Wave. Two-way wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from one location. Three-way wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from two separate locations. Four-way wiring configuration turns the light or appliance on/off from three separate locations. The Jasco Auxiliary Switch for Z-Wave is required for three-way or four-way installations. The dimmer switch includes an LED indicator light to easily locate the switch in a dark room. Take control of your home lighting with Jasco Z-Wave Wireless Lighting Controls! </lang></description><productName>In-Wall Smart Dimmer</productName><brandName>Jasco Products Company</brandName><productCode>14321 (ZW3005)</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="005e" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><assocGroups><assocGroup number="1" maxNodes="1"><description><lang xml:lang="en">Z-Wave Plus Lifeline</lang></description></assocGroup></assocGroups><configParams><configParam number="10" size="2" default="3" type="range"><name><lang xml:lang="en">Dim Rate Adjustments When manually controlling dimming</lang></name><description><lang xml:lang="en">Both the number of steps (or levels) that the dimmer will change and the timing of the steps can be modified to suit personal preferences. The timing of the steps can be adjusted in 10 millisecond intervals. As an example, the default setting for parameter 8 is 3. This means that the lighting level will change every 30 milliseconds when the Dim Command is received. A value of 255 would mean that the level would change every 2.55 seconds. Combined, the two parameters allow dim rate adjustments from 10 milliseconds to 4.2 minutes to go from maximum-to-minimum or minimum-to-maximum brightness levels.</lang></description><value from="1" to="255"><description><lang xml:lang="en">timing of the steps</lang></description></value></configParam><configParam number="11" size="1" default="1" type="range"><name><lang xml:lang="en">Dim Rate Adjustments When receiving an All-On or All-Off command</lang></name><description><lang xml:lang="en">Both the number of steps (or levels) that the dimmer will change and the timing of the steps can be modified to suit personal preferences.
