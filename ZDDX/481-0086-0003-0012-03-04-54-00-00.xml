And all of that remains true, but it no longer needs to be just the objects we put in our home that personalises it. Like the music that gently fills the background of your favourite restaurant, Aeotecs Micro Switches create the perfect ambiance for your home, and then some. They also give you the perfect control and the perfect, intelligent automation. Across three different Micro controllers, each one letting you perfect everything from your homes lights to its appliances and to its motorised doors and curtains, youll find that the same magic has been built right into the tiny body of each switch.</lang></description><productName>Micro Smart Energy Switch G2</productName><brandName>Aeotec</brandName><productCode>DSC18103-ZWAU</productCode></deviceDescription><commandClasses><commandClass id="0086" supported="true" controlled="false"/></commandClasses><resourceLinks><deviceImage url="https://products.z-wavealliance.org/ProductImages/Index?productName=ZC08-13030015"/></resourceLinks></ZWaveDevice>
